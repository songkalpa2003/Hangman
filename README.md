# Hangman
This is a simple hangman game that I made in Python. The rules are straight-forward, guess the word correctly by getting all the correct letters. I added an option that lets you pick how many guesses you want to use to allow users to either challenge themselves by picking less amount of guesses or letting them have it easy.

Some references that I used while implementing hangman game:
